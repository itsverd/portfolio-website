## How to do editing?

1. Before starting the editing process, it is recommended to have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS so that you won't face difficulties while editing files.
2. Perform editing through the index.html file; you can change the title, description, or other elements as you like.
3. If you want to modify the theme, colors, or anything related to design, you can edit the .scss files in the style folder. For global color changes, edit the _root.scss file in the style/modules folder.
